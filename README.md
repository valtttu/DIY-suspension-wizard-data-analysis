# DIY suspension wiward data analysis

This repository contains code for analyzing data from *DIY suspension wizard* MTB data logger ([see more here](https://wiki.aalto.fi/display/MEX/DIY+suspension+wizard+-+mountain+bike+suspension+data+logger)). The code is in both Jyputer notebook and Python code, so you can choose the one you prefer.

The folder `./data` contains example data obtained from full suspension bike without using GPS, when it was being pumped at a parking lot.
